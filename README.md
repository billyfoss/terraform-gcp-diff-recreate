```tf
# Copy-paste your Terraform configurations here - for large Terraform configs,
# please use a service like Dropbox and share a link to the ZIP file. For
# security, you can also encrypt the files using our GPG public key: https://www.hashicorp.com/security
# If reproducing the bug involves modifying the config file (e.g., apply a config,
# change a value, apply the config again, see the bug) then please include both the
# version of the config before the change, and the version of the config after the change.

### Panic Output

No panic

### Expected Behavior

Expected a new instance to get created and the instance group to be updated to include the new instance.  I also expected the description change to be ignored. 

### Actual Behavior

I received an error message.

Error: Error applying plan:

2 error(s) occurred:

* google_compute_instance_group.group[0]: google_compute_instance_group.group.0: diffs didn't match during apply. This is a bug with Terraform and should be reported as a GitHub Issue.

Please include the following information in your report:

    Terraform Version: 0.11.11

Also include as much context as you can about your config, state, and the steps you performed to trigger this error.

* google_compute_instance_group.group[1]: google_compute_instance_group.group.1: diffs didn't match during apply. This is a bug with Terraform and should be reported as a GitHub Issue.

Please include the following information in your report:

Terraform does not automatically rollback in the face of errors.
Instead, your Terraform state file has been partially updated with
any resources that successfully completed. Please address the error
above and apply again to incrementally change your infrastructure.
````

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup a default GCP project (or use an existing)
2. Place the service account json in the same directory
3. Update the terraform.tfvars to reflect the project name and credential file name
4. Create the initial set of resources 
  ````
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ````
5. Update the instance.tf to change the 2 places with DEBUG: and run again to update the resources

  ````
  terraform plan
  TF_DEBUG=trace  terraform apply
  ````
6. Review the trace output
7. NOTE: if you run terraform apply again, the process will be successful.
